# Ten lessons I learned after my first year in data analysis

***Jan 2, 2020 • Mark Bauer***

A few weeks ago, I posted my first open source data analysis project titled, "Exploring Art Galleries in Manhattan Using Python,” and published all the code on my GitHub. I attempted to demonstrate a typical data analysis workflow, specifically using NYC’s Open Data. Since a few readers expressed interest in understanding more about the data analysis process, I wanted to share some (non-technical) lessons that I wish I knew when I started data analysis.

## 1. Understand that *fearlessness* separates great students from good students ##

Before starting graduate school, I asked a data science professor the question, “What characteristics/traits separate great students from good students?” I was expecting answers such as hard working, curiosity, STEM backgrounds, etc. He thought about it for a moment and replied, “fearlessness.” I never forgot his answer and have seen it in practice. 

Lesson: At some point, there will be many smart students/colleagues in the room, but I’ve found that the ability to approach any and every problem truly separates students and carries over to becoming a good data analyst.

## 2. Don’t rely on someone else to teach you data analytics skills
There are many resources online with education platforms such as Coursera, edX, Udemy, and Udacity, to name a few. I find that high-performing students are learning machines and teach themselves skills.

Lesson: If you rely on a teacher to teach you something, not only is this a potential big risk (you might be disappointed in the end result), but it’s also a significant financial cost.

## 3. You can learn all of the basics online (if you have time to learn them)
Similar to the second bullet, many of the basic skills and concepts can be acquired online. This is also an effective way to see if you’re interested in the field. I’m a big supporter of online learning for skill acquisition.

Lesson: Invest time in online education platforms. Not only is this useful to learn skills, but it builds good learning habits. 

## 4. Review data analytics projects online
When I first started, I didn’t know what a complete data analytics/science project looked like. Homework assignments taught me to solve problems, but they tended to be isolated and removed from the broader context. Reviewing a typical data analytics project helped me identify the workflow and structure of the end product. I also learned how experienced analysts produce a project.

Lesson: Reviewing projects is a great way to build skills, but it’s also very useful in understanding the structure and elements of a project. Kaggle is great platform to see how data science projects are structured.

## 5. Start to do projects as soon as possible
When I first started, I believed that I needed to acquire skills at a sufficient level before I started, and then I’d be ready to start my own projects. Not only is this logic potentially incorrect, but it undermined the skills I’d learn while developing projects. Ultimately, you will run into problems not explicitly addressed by your teachers/colleagues, and it is your job to figure them out. This also teaches how to search for answers on Google. 

Lesson: Once you’ve acquired basic skills and understand terminology/concepts, it’s time to start to apply these skills. Your learning curve will grow immensely with this action.

## 6. Try to apply these skills to topics/projects you’re interested in
Why is it that homework assignments are never that interesting? I’ve found that if you want to improve your skills, tackle topics you’re interested in. Don’t think about business value, being practical, etc. The goal is to improve skills. The business value projects will ultimately come. 

Lesson: Make some of your early projects fun. You’ll stay motivated to push through obstacles. 

## 7. Ask for feedback as soon as possible
When I learn new things online, I find it’s often hard to ask for feedback. Thankfully, I had awesome mentors at NYU and my current job who helped me and suggested different ways to approach problems. Receiving advice from someone who has already put in the time is a very efficient way of learning. 

Lesson: Feedback is crucial. If you are lucky enough to have consistent feedback, even better.

## 8. Sit down with a friend and review code together
Similar to bullet 7, there’s nothing like consistent feedback and having someone walk through your code with you. In-person feedback is even better.

Lesson: It’s all about the people you work with, and in-person project reviews are extremely valuable to improve your learning in a small amount of time.

## 9. Join local tech meetups
This bullet also is similar to 7 and 8 (it’s all about people). I really started to improve my understanding of concepts, especially new concepts, when I joined the tech community in NYC. You meet people who are also passionate about the field and can explain things in a simple manner. You also learn things that you didn’t realize you needed to learn. These groups also tend to be useful for networking and job searching. 

Lesson: Join a community, find people who have similar interests, and take advantage of the resources these groups have to offer.

## 10. You get better with every project
When I started out, I wasn’t sure if I was improving. Is my code getting better? Am I understanding this stuff? Looking back at my old projects, I’ve made significant improvement. Every project presents its own challenges, and I’ve accumulated these solutions and have applied them to each new project. 

Lesson: Your first few projects are never that good (something we all accept). However, this is how you improve. Progress will come, and you will get better the more you do it.
